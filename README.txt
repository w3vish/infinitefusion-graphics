These are last month's community-made custom sprites for Pokémon Infinite Fusion. Put the .png files directly into in your game's Graphics\CustomBattlers folder and the game will automatically use them in place of the machine-generated sprites from http://pokefusion.japeal.com


A new sprite pack comes out every month. You can find the latest version of the sprite packs here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/11srKGH9s0K9u3XIiaCk4GFbaoNBMRBaS

The subfolders of the Other folder:

-Alternate Trainers contains sets of files to completely replace your trainer's appearance. The files are sorted by which folder they go in. Note that the game does not actually use trback100.png and trback101.png at time of writing.
-Base Sprites contains mostly unfused pokémon sprites, many of which were drawn from scratch for use as a base for a fusion sprite. The "96x96 sprites + assets" folder is specifically for assets useful to spriters.
-Characters contains files that go in Graphics\Characters
-Eggs contains files that go in Graphics\Battlers\Eggs
-Pictures contains sets of images that go in Graphics\Pictures (or Icons, where indicated) instead of Graphics\Custom Battlers. You can replace the same-named files already there if you prefer these.
-Titles contains files that go in Graphics\Titles
-Triples contains alternate sprites for the handful of triple-fusions that may appear late in the game.
-Misc files are files that were uploaded to the #assets-gallery channel which couldn't go into any of the other subfolders. Some may be replacements for tile assets, UI elements, ressources for spriters, etc.
